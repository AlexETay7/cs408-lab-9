# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

A fun little project demonstrating the power of a little JS, and some TLC (tender loving care).
This is a little game where there are balls bouncing around and you, the user, have control of one
hollow circle called the Evil Circle, and by using w,a,s, and d, you can move the evil circle and
eat the other circles.
